### Software Quality Assurance
1. **Concept:** Software quality is understood as the degree to which a system, component or process meets the specified requirements and expectations of customers or users.
2. **Software Quality Assurance Goals:** Set specific goals for the quality assurance process including ensuring that the software will fulfill functional requirements and meet requirements. on schedules and budgets and establish and manage activities to improve and enhance the efficiency of software development and maintenance.
3. **Validation Verification and Quality Assessment:** Introduces three aspects of ensuring the quality of software products:
    - Verification: Evaluate whether the product of a given development phase satisfies the conditions set at the start of that phase.
    - Validation: Evaluating a system or component to determine whether it meets specified requirements.
    - Qualification: Determine whether the system or component is suitable for use?
